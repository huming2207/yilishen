# YiLiShen

Project YiLiShen (Chinese: 蚁力神), a simple helper tool for Xiaomi Yeelight WiFi light bulbs/lamps/strips.

The name was taken from a famous Chinese Ponzi scheme scandal in a decade ago. Check [Yilishen Tianxi Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yilishen_Tianxi_Group) for more details.


## Development environment

- Ubuntu 18.04
- macOS 10.13.5

You may need to install rapidjson separately.

On macOS you should run: 

```
brew install rapidjson
```

On Ubuntu you should run

```
sudo apt install rapidjson-dev
```

I've only got two mono color light bulbs, so I can't test those color setting commands. But it should works.

## Sample Usage

Usage:

```
Yilishen <command>  [arg1] [arg2] [arg3] ... [argN]
```

Please refer to [Yeelight WiFi Light Inter-Operation Specification](https://www.yeelight.com/download/Yeelight_Inter-Operation_Spec.pdf) for more details
